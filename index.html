            <p>Budgeting means tracking your income and expenses so you can spend smartly and save wisely. It’s about how you divide your income based on your needs and wants. Here we help you understand how to divide your income effectively.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prevents overspending: You know where your money goes.</li>

                <li><b>50/30/20 Rule:</b> 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/investments.</li>
                <li>Every rupee you earn is assigned a purpose — nothing goes unplanned.</li>

      <h1>Monetary System</h1>
      <p>
        The monetary system of a country refers to the framework through which money is created, managed, 
        and circulated in the economy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Monetary System in India:</b> India follows a managed paper currency system, also called a fiat money system — 
        which means our currency, the Indian Rupee (₹), is not backed by gold or silver, but by the trust in the 
        Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The official currency is the Indian Rupee (₹), issued and controlled by the RBI. One Rupee = 100 Paise.</li>
        <li>The RBI, established in 1935 under the RBI Act of 1934, manages money supply, prints currency, controls inflation, and maintains economic stability.</li>
        <li>All notes except the ₹1 note and coins are issued by the RBI; ₹1 note and coins are issued by the Government of India.</li>
        <li>The RBI regulates money flow through tools like repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, and SLR.</li>
        <li>India's digital payment systems — UPI, NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS — ensure fast, secure transactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <h2>Role of the Monetary System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintains price stability and controls inflation.</li>
        <li>Ensures sustainable economic growth.</li>
        <li>Facilitates trade and investment.</li>
        <li>Builds trust and efficiency in financial transactions.</li>
      </ul> -->
