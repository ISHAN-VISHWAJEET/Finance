    <h1 style="font-family: 'Raleway'; text-decoration: none;">Budgeting</h1>
    <p>
      Budgeting refers to the process of creating a plan to spend your money wisely. It helps you balance your income and expenses, save for future goals, and avoid unnecessary debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Budgeting in India:</b> The Government of India prepares an annual budget that outlines estimated revenues and expenditures for the upcoming financial year. It plays a crucial role in maintaining financial discipline and economic growth.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Union Budget is presented every year by the Finance Minister in Parliament, usually in February.</li>
      <li>It includes two main parts — the Revenue Budget and the Capital Budget.</li>
      <li>The Revenue Budget covers government income (like taxes) and expenses (like subsidies and salaries).</li>
      <li>The Capital Budget deals with investments, loans, and infrastructure development.</li>
      <li>Personal budgeting helps individuals manage spending, save, and invest effectively.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1 style="font-family: 'Raleway'; text-decoration: none;">Monetary System</h1>
      <p>
        The monetary system of a country refers to the framework through which money is created, managed, 
        and circulated in the economy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Monetary System in India:</b> India follows a managed paper currency system, also called a fiat money system — 
        which means our currency, the Indian Rupee (₹), is not backed by gold or silver, but by the trust in the 
        Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The official currency is the Indian Rupee (₹), issued and controlled by the RBI. One Rupee = 100 Paise.</li>
        <li>The RBI, established in 1935 under the RBI Act of 1934, manages money supply, prints currency, controls inflation, and maintains economic stability.</li>
        <li>All notes except the ₹1 note and coins are issued by the RBI; ₹1 note and coins are issued by the Government of India.</li>
        <li>The RBI regulates money flow through tools like repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, and SLR.</li>
        <li>India's digital payment systems — UPI, NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS — ensure fast, secure transactions.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="insurance-text" >
    <h1 style="font-family: 'Raleway'; text-decoration: none;">Insurance System</h1>
    <p>
      The insurance system provides financial protection against unexpected losses or risks.
      It works on the principle of risk pooling — where many people pay small premiums so that
      the few who face loss are compensated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Insurance System in India:</b> India has a well-regulated insurance market governed by
      the <b>Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)</b>. It ensures the
      stability, transparency, and security of insurance companies and protects policyholders’ interests.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insurance provides a safety net for individuals and businesses during financial hardships.</li>
      <li>There are two major types — <b>Life Insurance</b> and <b>General Insurance</b>.</li>
      <li>Life Insurance covers death or maturity benefits; General Insurance covers health, motor, property, etc.</li>
      <li>IRDAI, established in 1999, supervises and promotes fair practices in the insurance sector.</li>
      <li>Popular public insurers include LIC, New India Assurance, and Oriental Insurance.</li>
    </ul>

      also known as <b>stocks</b>. It helps businesses raise capital and allows investors to earn profits 
      through share price appreciation and dividends.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Stock Market in India:</b> India’s stock market is among the largest in the world, driven by 
      exchanges like the <b>BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)</b> and <b>NSE (National Stock Exchange)</b>.
