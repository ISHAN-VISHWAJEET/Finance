      <h1 style="font-family: 'Raleway'; text-decoration: none;">Monetary System</h1>
      <p>
        The monetary system of a country refers to the framework through which money is created, managed, 
        and circulated in the economy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Monetary System in India:</b> India follows a managed paper currency system, also called a fiat money system — 
        which means our currency, the Indian Rupee (₹), is not backed by gold or silver, but by the trust in the 
        Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The official currency is the Indian Rupee (₹), issued and controlled by the RBI. One Rupee = 100 Paise.</li>
        <li>The RBI, established in 1935 under the RBI Act of 1934, manages money supply, prints currency, controls inflation, and maintains economic stability.</li>
        <li>All notes except the ₹1 note and coins are issued by the RBI; ₹1 note and coins are issued by the Government of India.</li>
        <li>The RBI regulates money flow through tools like repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, and SLR.</li>
        <li>India's digital payment systems — UPI, NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS — ensure fast, secure transactions.</li>
